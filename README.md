# Vinicius Centurion
Hi, I'm Centurion. A civil engineer passionate about programming. I am always looking for new ways to make everyday activities easier for my co-workers, employees and suppliers.

So i decided: I should get a Computer Science bachelor's degree and try to develop applications that make construction management tasks less time consuming and stressful.
