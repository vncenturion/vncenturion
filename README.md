# :construction_worker: Vinicius Centurion
Hi, I'm Vinicius Centurion. A civil/ohs/industrial engineer and attorney (I understand that this may make me appear indecisive or unfocused, but what I can confidently say is that I am someone who is passionate about acquiring knowledge and is interested in a wide range of subjects. I believe that being an eclectic learner has given me unique perspectives and the ability to approach problems from various angles) passionate about programming, AI, automation, IoT. I'm always looking for new ways to make everyday activities easier for my co-workers, employees and suppliers.

During the COVID-19 lockdown in Brazil, I began studying two IT degrees - computer science and computer networks. I am set to graduate from both of these degrees this year. Additionally, I started a Master's degree in IT this year (It really seems that I have a huge love for the university, doesn't it?) and have been conducting research on AI applications in building construction (here is a theme where I can take advantage of some knowledge in different areas), as well as the automation of construction inspection routines.

Note feel free to collaborate on projects, to chat (PT, EN, ES, FR) or share ideas.
