# :construction_worker: Vinicius Centurion
I have experience in developing systems for the administrative sectors of the Brazilian Judiciary. Mostly using django/python and postgres. Also, developing dynamic websites, front and back. Recording videos and writing user guides, as well as documenting the software. Unfortunately, most of it cannot be shared here, but I intend to develop simplified versions that are similar to those originally developed by me, and that can be shared without major copyright or security issues.
Note > feel free to collaborate on projects, to chat (PT, EN, ES, FR) or share ideas.
